 version: specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
- services: defines the services that will be created.
    - mongodb: a service named "mongodb" that uses the official MongoDB image, maps port 27017 on the host machine to port 27017 in the container, and mounts a volume at /var/databases/mongodb/ecommerce to persist data.
    - api: a service named "api" that builds the FastAPI application from the current directory (using the Dockerfile), maps port 8888 on the host machine to port 8888 in the container, and sets an environment variable MONGO_URI to connect to the MongoDB service. It also depends on the mongodb service, meaning it won't start until mongodb is up and running.

This file is used to define the infrastructure for a Docker-based application, including a MongoDB database and a FastAPI backend. The frontend code would likely be a separate service or container that communicates with the api service to retrieve or send data.
